<strong>String[] git.diffFiles()</strong>

<p> Get a list of files that differ between two refs. Available parameters: </p>

    <li> sourceRef: name of the source ref to use. Default is HEAD. </li>
    <li> fetchRemote: name of the remote to fetch. If not set, nothing is fetched.
    <li> gitCredentialsId: the credentials ID to use to fetch from the remote.
                           if not set, anonymous fetching will be attempted </li>
    <li> allChanges: if true, fetch all changes between the refs. if false, only
                      the changes from the source will be listed. More explicitly,
                      allChanges: true corresponds to "git diff targetRef..sourceRef"
                      while allChanges: false corresponds to "git diff targetRef...sourceRef".
                      Default is false </li>

<strong>Map git.merge()</strong>

<p> Merge a target ref into the current branch and (optionally) push upstream.
Available parameters are: </p>
<ul>
    <li> currentBranch: name of the branch to be currently checked out. Since Jenkins checks out
                        in detached head state, this parameter is required</li>
    <li> targetBranch: name of the branch to merge into currentBranch *from the remote*. Required.</li>
    <li> gitCredentialsId: name of the credentials ID to use to push changes back to git</li>
    <li> push: true if the merged changes should be pushed (default), false otherwise</li>
    <li> remote: name of the remote to push to. Default is origin</li>
