# Jenkins Shared Libraries for Amber

The shared libraries here are written to aid in automated tests through Jenkins
for the Amber project. Many projects are hosted on GitHub in the Amber-MD
organization. The main Amber repository is hosted on a private GitLab server
at https://gitlab.ambermd.org.

The shared pipeline libraries included in this repository aim to extract
common, generalized functionality useful in Jenkins CI pipelines and pack them
into reusable functions that are easily imported.
